## 🚀 Inspiration  
Meal planning and food discovery can often be overwhelming, especially with dietary restrictions, preferences, or language barriers. Our goal was to create an *intelligent, multilingual AI chatbot* that simplifies food exploration and offers truly personalized recommendations for users from diverse backgrounds.

---

## 🧠 What It Does  
Our chatbot enhances food discovery through:

- 🗣️ **Voice-enabled, multilingual interaction** – Supports multiple Indian languages for a wider reach.  
- 🍛 **Personalized food recommendations** – Tailored suggestions based on taste, dietary needs, and past choices.  
- 🧠 **Conversational memory** – Learns from previous interactions to provide smarter, adaptive responses.  
- 🤖 **Virtual assistant UI** – Offers an intuitive and engaging user interface for seamless interaction.

---

## ⚙️ How We Built It  
- **Frontend**: Developed using **Streamlit**, featuring voice input in various Indian languages.  
- **Backend**: Python-based **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** engine for intelligent food suggestion generation.  
- **AI/ML Models**:
  - Local models for multilingual NLP, keyword extraction, and reinforced learning.
  - Keyword vectors are embedded and searched in a **vector database** for top cluster matches.  
- **Speech-to-Text**: Integrated APIs for accurate multilingual voice recognition.  
- **Recommendation Flow**:
  - Voice/Text → NLP Processing → Embedding Generation → Vector DB Search → Top 5 Results Returned.

---

## 💡 Challenges We Faced  
- 🌐 **Multilingual NLP** – Ensuring robust performance across diverse Indian languages.  
- 🧷 **Efficient Keyword Mapping** – Designing optimized vector embeddings for faster search.  
- 🧩 **UI/UX Design** – Crafting an intuitive and responsive virtual assistant interface.  

We overcame these challenges using model fine-tuning, performance optimizations, and user testing.
